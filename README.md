# Weather Dashboard

## Search for Weather 

The Weather Dashboard allows users to search any city in the world to find:
* current temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv index,
* five day forecast including forecasted temperature and humidity,
* icons displaying current and forecasted weather conditions,
* warnings for any uv index rating greater than 3 or wind speeds in excess of 70 km/hr

Cities that are previously searched are listed as a "Previous Search" and can information on those cities can be refreshed by clicking on that city name. 

## Technology Used

This application searches and retrieves data from openweathermap.org through an API.
